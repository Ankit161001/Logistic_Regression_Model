# Logistic_Regression_Model
This is the general code for creating a logistic regression model.
In this Machine Learning Model we are able to predict a binary outcome. In this example code we use the Cars' specs dataset. We predict the cars Gear System - Automatic(1) or Manual(0) - (AM)  from different independent variables.

<br>
 Before getting started with the code, be sure that you have pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn installed on your PC.
  <br>
  To install the above packages, open cmd and type `pip install pandas`, `pip install numpy`, `pip install matplotlib` and 
  `pip install seaborn` to install all the required packages.
  <br>
  Feel free to use the dataset I used i.e. `cars.csv`.

  ### Code Description::
  The following steps are followed in the notebook:: <br>
  1)  Importing libraries for exploratory Data Analysis & Data Visualization <br>
  2)  importing Data <br>
  3)  Exloratory Data Analysis & Visualization is performed <br>
  4)  training and testing model selection <br>
  5)  Importing machine learning algorithm i.e. linear regression <br>
  6)  Finally values are predicted <br>
